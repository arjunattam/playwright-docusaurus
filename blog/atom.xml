        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Playwright 1.6 is available today, with improvements to network
capabilities: inspect WebSocket connections, export network activity as HAR and
access <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Resource_Timing_API/Using_the_Resource_Timing_API">resource timing</a> for network responses. This release also adds a new API for touchscreen taps. Like other input
methods, touchscreen taps auto-wait for the underlying element to be ready, to
improve the reliability of automation.</p>
